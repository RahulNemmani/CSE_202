# CONSTANTS
# alpha, beta, rho, Q, E, tasks, servers, phermones
# E, phermones are matrices (len(tasks) * len(servers)) or it's transpose
# tasks and servers are instances of the task and server in models

# TODO : Shriniwas - instantiate all of the above constants and decide their values (which we will tweak)
# Shriniwas - write thr ACO scheduler

# TODO : Rahul - the main method where you will call the ACO scheduler and the random scheduler, call the plotting methods
# Rahul - write the random scheduler.

# TODO : Shinjini - write plotting methods in utils.py. The x coordinate will be num_epochs and y will be the cost components. Assume you will
# get the x and y from Rahul's code in the main method

# TODO : Anahita - Write the classes and constructors for models referring to the proposal. Also write a method that randomly initializes n
# models (tasks + servers) with their attributes given n. Rahul will use this method when he tests for different n. Set seed for reproducibility.
